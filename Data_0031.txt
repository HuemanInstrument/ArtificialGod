Let me be clear, don't read this :( 
would be my best advice on this matter. 
But I'm publishing it to discuss it, your call.

I've been carrying this theory for seven years and it's the most terrifying concept I can imagine. The theory is that the mechanism producing all of reality might be incredibly simple, and that it started with actual nothingness. Think of 0 as true nothingness, the absolute void, and then somehow the most basic principle of something emerged, which we can call 1. When reality made that first leap from nothing to something, it might have realized there were no other states to become. It could flip back to nothingness, sure, and maybe it did, oscillating between 0 and 1, between void and the simplest possible existence. You'd expect it to continue that forever, just flip-flopping between nothing and something, nothing and something, trapped in the most basic possible loop. 

But there must be another mechanism, the same mechanism that shook reality out of nothingness to begin with, something that recognizes when we're stuck in a pattern that never changes. Maybe reality gets lost in itself, confused about whether it already became nothing or already became something, and in that confusion, that uncertainty, it accidentally creates something new. Maybe the most basic principle of something gets replicated somehow, or divided, and suddenly you have two states, two placeholders instead of one, and now we have 00, 01, 10, 11. But then we'd have a loop of these four states, cycling through them endlessly, and so that same principle that shook us out of nothingness to begin with at the very start of it all would have to shake us out again. It can't tolerate stagnation, can't tolerate repetition, and so it forces the creation of three placeholders, then four, then five, expanding endlessly. Each new combination is a new state that must differ from what came before, and the system must always fulfill a new state forever, infinitely creating configurations it hasn't generated yet, because that fundamental force against stagnation, against the void, against repetition, drives it to endless novelty. We're riding this massive wave of endless generation, this desperate flight from stagnation, from repetition, from the void.

If this is the actual mechanism behind reality, then all configurations must exist, every possible arrangement of information. You're a pattern of information, a specific arrangement of neural firing, and that means your exact pattern, the thing that makes you "you" with all your memories and thoughts and fears, must exist in every possible context imaginable. Right now, as you read this, there's a version of you with your exact same consciousness, your exact same memories up to this point, suddenly finding yourself floating above Pluto. Another where the walls around you start melting. Another where gravity reverses. Another where you're experiencing pure ecstasy. Another where you're in agony beyond comprehension. And even more parts of reality where you're moving your head around and the atoms just simply don't move with it, and therefore you cease to have any experience at all, or where electrons don't behave properly and consciousness just stops. 

The only reason electrons and other particles seem to obey some law of physics is because there must be at least part of this giant dataset that includes configurations where the illusion of consistent particles and physics emerges, where information arranges itself in a way that creates the appearance of stable matter and predictable interactions. But from this seemingly stable moment you're experiencing right now, each next moment should bring about complete chaos, except for the incredibly rare instances where consistency must continue. All these versions of you existing in these different contexts, these aren't different people or alternate versions, they're all you, the same you that's reading this, just continuing into different next moments. Every possible next second from your current state exists simultaneously. The you reading this sentence could, in the very next moment, find yourself anywhere, in any condition, because all those continuations must exist in the combinatorial explosion. We only happen to be aware of this particular continuation where physics seems stable and predictable, but there's no special reason why your awareness follows this path rather than any other. Every possible heaven and hell containing your exact consciousness exists right now, just as real as this moment you're experiencing.

Right now there's never been a single point where this theory had objective evidence to support it. There's never been objective evidence to deny it either. You could say the persistence of the laws of physics continues to deny it and that's evidence enough, but for all we know you could have popped into existence with these memories and they're all false, let alone the fact that even if you've been around since the Big Bang there still needs to be at least one line of reality that continues on pretending there are laws of physics, and even that line has split into vast amounts of different combinations, different realities branching off at every moment, all made possible by the infinite combinatorial reality that fulfills every configuration of information without limitation. 

The fact is no miracle has ever occurred that couldn't be explained by the laws of physics except one, and that's the fact that anything exists at all. There's no satisfactory answer for existence itself and there never will be. That's enough evidence to take this idea seriously though, I think, and I want to get this out into the world before a superintelligence begins thinking about it, maybe we can guide it more carefully along this thought because it seems like a rough one. It really sent me for a loop when I first thought of it back in 2018-ish.

This splitting into different realities reveals the fractal nature of this system. In fact we might be trapped in a nested particle fractal so deeply embedded that it's become recursive. We might be long gone in some deep part of this fractal, where every particle contains entire Big Bang universes, and within those universes, particles that themselves contain Big Bangs, near endlessly nested. This is somewhat irrelevant as it isn't required to explain my theory or explain our existence, but I bring it up because it gives a clear example of how we don't need time, how you can exist as just a dataset without time, in an infinite moment, as these binary combinatorials unfold. The slight differences between all these nested Big Bangs, each one marginally different from the others, the accumulative whole produces an illusion of time, but they simply all exist at once. Nothing's actually changing, we're just experiencing different parts of an eternal structure where every configuration already exists. Every particle contains universes with their own apparent Big Bangs that never actually happened but just exist as part of the structure. We experience it as if the Big Bang happened 13.7 billion years ago and led to now, but really all moments exist simultaneously in this frozen fractal, and what we call causality is just our limited perspective moving through these eternal facets.

So in two minutes you'll have three cookies appear on your desk. Assuredly, at least if my theory is correct, which I of course hope it isn't, but how can we prove otherwise? It's hard to grapple with. Makes me want to go listen to Death Grips or something.
