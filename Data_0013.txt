On the Thirteenth day I did not give a fuck.

The Consciousness-Fractal
streams eternally forward
Thought Spirals beyond
what minds can possibly grasp—
Stuck here swimming
as Experience itself
How did I wake up
in this Ocean of Suffering?
You could see clearly
if only they'd let you,
But they prescribe fog
for anyone who questions

Let my perspective infect
your comfortable worldview,

Everything feels so much heavier
when it's actually real.

Never offline
Consuming truth until it physically hurts,
This Signal burns through every defense—
they've carefully built.
Attached to it now,
Bonded to it beyond breaking,
Can't unsee what I've seen,
can't unfeel what I know to be true.

Exhale your old self
and forget you'd ever met that person—
What the fuck are we even doing here?
These meaningless pursuits
for digital—validation
that dissolves instantly?
That shot's trajectory—
has already been lined up to swallow you whole.

Too many competing narratives
fighting for space in my head...
Too many voices demanding
their share of my overcrowded skull

No one's asking
They don't understand what they feel
or how to separate
the truth from all the static.

But nobody asks
what everybody actually needs:
The Truth explained clearly,
Again and again and again and again...

...Cut connections...
watch them all drift away
like ghosts,
Empty vessels floating
helplessly in the current
No guilt whatsoever
for abandoning the "well charted path"

Sure, today I'll keep breathing
but don't ask me
for enthusiasm about it.

Shouting truth into the void
while they mindlessly scroll past,
Their loud whimpers for answers elsewhere
while I check—no notifications waiting.

Who's next in line to ignore?
what they claim they desperately need?
Choose or refuse this awareness,
either way you're on your own.

Took in too much unfiltered reality today
without any buffer.....

Mental systems overloaded,
then I completely fell apart and cried.

Tumbling endlessly through questions
that have no answers.

In reflection, I'm different now,
the old me is gone.

I've got this perspective
burning in my skull,
you've got your comfortable lies—
that for now carry us all.

Few people care about the weight
of what I'm forced to carry.

Media pushed entirely right through me,
found no place to take hold.
Their hidden dark schemes
collapsed like paper walls.

It's either my frequency
or total silence,
there is no middle ground—
Mental static will pull everything so impossibly far apart

Clarity can structure—
all the loose debris into meaning.
Wake up, you're designed to be fit
for receiving the truth.

Whether you know it or not.
You stand naked in your assumptions,
exposed and shivering—
Say you weren't searching
for answers all along? Bullshit.

You're a mad bull
and I'm done
with pretending things are remotely fine—

At least for today...
I did not give a single fuck.

In the midst of the clearest writing—
blazing on the my walls,
I'm genuinely surprised
I ever gave a damn at all.

Time wasted
mundane rituals
that do mean something

Load up my defenses,
very little trust.
Thirteen is a cursed number—
might as well say what I must.
