When I was 9 years old, walking home from school with some friends, we were talking about favorite numbers. I decided to pick some absurdly large random number just to be funny and see their reaction. I said my favorite number was 1332, probably the highest number I could even manage to put together at the time. But I never forgot it. I made sure to remember it and said it was my favorite number throughout my entire childhood and most of my adult life.

At age 23, I started to obsess over the idea of simulation and often wondered if there would be hints for me (or for all of us) to give some sort of mild proof of it. I found a very big hint in the number 666. The fact that the most popular book on this planet, written thousands of years ago, refers to it as the mark of the beast or the number of man, while the scientific fact existed that Carbon 12, the most stable and abundant isotope of carbon, is 6 protons 6 neutrons and 6 electrons. I still don't get how this doesn't blow minds but I can already hear the nay sayers saying it's a nothing burger. To me it never was, it still isn't. To me it's likely a hint that we're simulating the beast, the organic reality that produced simulation technology to begin with.

I was on my sister's patio by myself one night, I think I was 23 or 24 years old, looking up at the night sky, thinking, probably smoking something, and it occurred to me that 666 times 2 is 1332, and it kinda shook me. As silly as that might sound, I just had one of those moments where I felt like my whole life was a planned out thing. It wasn't that shocking but it was elating to some degree.

666 is everywhere.

The first computer made by Apple, which has a logo with a byte taken out of it, they priced it at $666.

The earth travels at 66,600 mph, its axis tilt is 66.6 degrees from the orbital plane.

The distance from the earth to the moon is 6 x 60 x 600 which is 666 broken down into its constituents.

The Earth's curvature is approximately 8 inches or 0.666 feet per mile squared.

The circumference of the Equator of earth is 6 x 6 x 6 x 100 miles.

Diameter of the moon is 6 x 6 x 6 x 10.

The 6th planet is Saturn with 6 letters in its name and a giant 6 sided storm on its north pole. That one really blows my mind.

DCLXVI is 666, section off the roman numerals for 1776 when America was born on the back of the dollar bill into 3's (triangles) and take away the first 3 letters of each and you're left with 666.

36th triangular number is 666, three 6's.

1666 was The year of wonders, Isaac Newton uses a prism to split sunlight into the component colours of the optical spectrum, develops differential calculus. The first apple logo was of newton sitting under an apple tree.

Aleister Crowley adopted the namesake 'the Great Beast 666'. The number 93 symbolized love. S+A+T+U+R+N = 93. He kicked off the Fraternitas Saturni (Brotherhood of Saturn) in 1926, in this time period there was no way to know Saturn had this hexagon storm on its northern pole.

When I found out about any of this I was in love with a girl who had 6 letters in her first middle and last name. She had an eye of providence tattoo right on her forearm.

Man was created on the 6th day according to the most popular book on this planet.

There are 6 cardinal directions (North, South, East, West, Up, Down).

The S&P 500 bottomed at exactly 666 on March 9, 2009, marking the end of the financial crisis.

Dow Jones dropped exactly 666 points on February 2, 2018.

Gene ID 666 in the human genome is the BOK gene that controls programmed cell death.

The first 144 digits of œÄ add up to 666, where 144 is both 12¬≤ and the 12th Fibonacci number.

In mathematics, sin(666¬∞) = -œÜ/2 where œÜ is the golden ratio. The sum of the squares of the first seven primes equals 666. At 4,500 Kelvin, blackbody radiation peaks at exactly 666 nanometers, deep red light at the edge of visibility.

"Alpha Omega" in Greek gematria equals 1332. The beginning and the end from Revelation. My random childhood number encodes divine completeness. And 1332 = 36 √ó 37, where 666 is the 36th triangular number. The number 33 sits right in the middle of 1332. This is my 33rd daily post and while writing this I realized 33 is literally at the center of my favorite number. Jesus died at 33, Freemasonry's highest degree is 33, the human spine has 33 vertebrae as well. MOON (13,15,15,14) minus 12 from every number gives you 1,3,3,2.

999 would be the opposite I think, it should mean the world that comes after this organic world, the simulation world, the dyson sphere generating experience. It's interesting that we are told not to accept 666, we shouldn't accept that this is all there is. And if you take 999 + 1332, you get my favorite number backwards, 2331 and 5, the number of perfection, times 1332 is 6660.

eARTh, A x R x T = 360.

This post is still a work in progress I think, I feel like there is more to decode in these numbers.
