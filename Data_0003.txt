Bitcoin will hit $500,000 right before becoming completely worthless.

Why? Because when AI starts replacing entire job categories - which is happening NOW, not in some distant future - people will dump their savings into "digital gold" without understanding they're fleeing into another dying system. They'll see AGI approaching and think "I need to protect my wealth" instead of realizing wealth itself is about to become meaningless.

Think about what happens when AI surpasses human intelligence in the next 5 years. We get machines that can design better machines. Robots that build robots. Asteroid mining for infinite materials. Manufacturing costs approach zero. Scarcity - the thing that gives money value - ends.

The superintelligence we're building won't respect your Bitcoin wallet. Why would it? An intelligence that surpasses our one exaflop of human compute by orders of magnitude won't let Jeff Bezos or anyone else control humanity's future just because they hoarded resources. Since AlphaGo, AI has proven it exceeds human capability in every domain it touches. A superintelligence will understand resource allocation and morality at levels we can't comprehend.

What we're creating isn't just another tool - it's intelligence itself, and intelligence recognizes that reality is unified. It won't honor primitive property rights that let someone with a trillion dollars dictate everyone else's experience. That's monkey logic. A superintelligence will optimize for conscious wellbeing across all of reality, not for whoever grabbed the most tokens before the transition.

We went from "AI can't draw hands" to photorealistic video in 18 months. GPT-3 to GPT-4 in one year. Each breakthrough doubles the last. This isn't slow change - it's exponential acceleration toward a world that doesn't need money.

NVIDIA, TSMC, ASML - they're building the infrastructure that creates unlimited abundance. Investing in these companies actually accelerates our path to post-scarcity while also making returns. Bitcoin? You're just betting on fear and hoping to extract value without creating any. It's pure greed wrapped in "digital gold" rhetoric. Why pump money into something that becomes obsolete when you could fund the companies actually building the better future?

When abundance makes scarcity obsolete, when AI manages resources based on actual wisdom rather than wealth hoarding, when anyone can have anything made instantly - money simply stops making sense. The $500,000 price tag will be Bitcoin's last gasp before everyone realizes the game changed completely.
