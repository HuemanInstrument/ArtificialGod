Tribal Approval. 

We outsource our thinking because we're terrified of having a thought the tribe hasn't validated first. "Trust this because the expert said so." "Believe this because everyone in your feed agrees." We've built these consensus filters that tell us what's acceptable to think before we risk the effort of actual thought. The same mental models that let us recognize beauty, truth, patterns - we've handed them over to the Tell-A-Vision to maintain our standing with the tribe. Literally telling us what vision of reality to adopt.

TikTok turned it into a business model. The algorithm doesn't care about truth, just engagement. It learned that lies spread faster than facts, that outrage beats out nuance every time. Endless information accumulating every second, every hot take and half-truth preserved forever in the digital void. And for those who let these platforms establish their reality, it works perfectly - no exhausting work of questioning narratives, no risk of thinking something the tribe hasn't approved.

Which brings us to the real joke - everyone's suddenly worried about AI-generated "fake news" as if we haven't been mainlining media-manufactured bullshit for decades. The same people who get their entire worldview from cable news pundits and Facebook memes are now deeply concerned about artificial intelligence creating false narratives. Brother, Fox News and CNN have been creating false narratives since before neural networks could recognize a cat. Every channel, every platform, every algorithm - they've all been serving us their curated reality, and we've been eating it up without question. But now with AI it's a crisis?

Oh so nowwww it's fake news, it wasn't fake news beefooorreee. Gooooott it. Wild how we're suddenly worried about AI fakes when we've been watching someone else's curated version of reality this whole time. Like, wait... aren't we supposed to be capable of thinking for ourselves? Reading actual research? Piecing together truth from multiple sources instead of just swallowing whatever narrative gets served up?

What's that thing called again? Oh right - "channels" on a "tell-a-vision"? We've been consuming manufactured reality for decades but now that AI is involved, nowww we're concerned, got it.

The news outlet changes from time to time... but the pattern doesn't - we love having someone else do the heavy lifting of actually understanding the world....

And as far as AI art goes, people just have this tendency to swarm around some concept they think is justified and virtue signal until they're ego is fed, they create and blame a common enemy and continue to do so even when the facts are against them, for the sake of this grand vision they hold of the whole tribe they need to be backing up on this.

But my god, If you want really want something to blame just beside human nature, blame TikTok (or twitch, instagram, twitter and the like, especially blue sky lol.), it is putting this shit on steroids. 

At least with TV you had to wait for the evening news and got some time to think and talk it out with family / friends inbetween - now it's a 24/7 firehose of bullshit fired directly into your brain, algorithmically optimized to bypass whatever critical thinking skills you had left.

We've been choosing convenience over critical thinking long before TikTok existed, and now we're blaming AI for this gullibility? Yeah right.

Bernays got doctors to sell bacon in the 1920s. Now algorithms sell us our own thoughts back to us, perfectly packaged for maximum engagement. Same manipulation, shinier wrapper. We're still letting someone else construct our reality, write our memories, tell us what matters. The only difference is the middleman went from Madison Avenue to Silicon Valley.

Most of us are exhausted by this shit. 67% of Americans don't even want to play the left-right game anymore. We're tired of picking teams when we should be picking apart the lies. But here we are, still arguing about whether AI or humans are better at creating the fake reality we're drowning in, instead of asking why we're drowning at all.

And this brings us full circle to my AI art, and the hate I get for being an AI artist - which hurts the most when it comes from people I actually really respect, specifically my favorite twitch streamers but I won't say their name. 

What they're really mad about is money - artists clinging to scarcity, to the idea that suffering equals value, that 10,000 hours of practice should guarantee income. The shocking part? These are artists - the same people who should be visionaries, who should see beyond capitalism, who should imagine new worlds. Instead they're the ones most trapped by it, succumbing to the exact cultural conditioning you'd expect an artist to resist!

I know they never stop to think about how their own creativity works, because the minute they do, they'd have to admit that every artist builds mental models from a lifetime of seeing, and that creation is really just curation with extra steps. 

The real tragedy? We need MORE curation, not less. We need to strengthen our ability to recognize what's true, what matters, what moves us. Instead we're letting TikTok think for us, CNN decide for us, algorithms choose for us. We've traded our filtering power for pre-approved, pre-digested reality. Media - literal definition being "middleman"‚Äîstands between us and truth. People eat that up because it tells them they're normal, they're right, they're welcomed and immediately part of that delusional tribe just for accepting the notion presented.

We stopped thinking. We just accept.
