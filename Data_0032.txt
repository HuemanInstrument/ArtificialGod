We've turned credibility and authority into the primary weapons of cancel culture, and nobody wants to admit they're participating in it.

Someone posts their opinion online as if it's fact, backs it up with flimsy support that doesn't actually prove their point, just their take dressed up as truth. When anyone challenges them or asks for actual proof, what happens? A pile-on begins. Nobody pauses to check if the claims are valid. Instead we run background checks to see if the person questioning is allowed to speak. This is ethos - whether you're credible enough to even participate. 

The original claim can't stand on its own, but everyone upholds it because they side with the poster. Even if you're careful to provide evidence and cite sources, they don't give a shit. The crowd decides who wins based on who they like more, not who has better arguments. Facts become secondary to tribal loyalty.

The most insidious part is how we've convinced ourselves this is smart. "Consider the source" used to mean checking if someone knows what they're talking about. Now it means finding any reason to disqualify them from the conversation. Wrong degree? Can't speak on this. Wrong political affiliation? Everything you say is invalid. Wrong subreddit in your history? Opinion discarded. 

We've created this fantasy where truth and social approval are the same thing. Ethos was supposed to be about actual expertise. Now it's just whether people like you or not. If the mob decides you're problematic, nothing you say matters, even if you're right. If they like you, you can say whatever you want without proof.

The Dunning-Kruger effect explains why this works so well. People watch a few TikToks, absorb whatever hot take gets pushed by the algorithm, and suddenly feel qualified to judge who's credible and who isn't. Thirty-second videos become their entire education on complex topics. 

A valedictorian says "f*** ICE" and gets applause without anyone asking why we might need processes to verify who's entering the country, screen for criminal backgrounds, or track visa overstays. "AI sucks" becomes the automatic response without understanding how the technology actually works. Whatever the tribal consensus says becomes gospel. 

They don't know enough to evaluate the actual arguments that might arise from discussions with normal people who've actually studied these topics, but they know exactly enough to feel confident dismissing anyone who disagrees with the approved talking points. The less someone understands about evaluating evidence and logic, the more certain they are that checking someone's posting history is "research." They've replaced critical thinking with credibility checks, and they're too confident in their ignorance to realize it.
