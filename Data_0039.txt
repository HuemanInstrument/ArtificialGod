Polyamory and Monogamy.

This is likely useful for your own mental reference on either side of the argument:

The fact is, the human brain remains fundamentally a black box - we can observe inputs and outputs, but the subjective experience of consciousness itself remains opaque to scientific measurement. When researchers claim polyamorous individuals report similar satisfaction to monogamous couples, they're measuring what people say about their internal states, not the internal states themselves. This is particularly significant when we consider the actual numbers: despite decades of advocacy and increasing visibility, only about 2-3% of American adults are currently in consensually non-monogamous relationships. Even if we generously assume similar rates globally (though they're likely much lower in less progressive nations), we're talking about perhaps 2-5% of humanity experimenting with alternatives to monogamy.

But here's the crucial point: true committed polyamory - the actual long-term, multiple-partner relationships that advocates promote - is likely a fraction of even that tiny percentage. Most of that 2-5% are casual arrangements, swinging, or open relationships, not the complex emotional partnerships polyamory claims to represent. While research on relationship duration is limited, the fact that many more people have tried these arrangements than currently practice them suggests they typically don't last long. The vast majority - roughly 95%+ of humans worldwide - practice monogamy or, in some cultures, traditional polygynous arrangements (one male with multiple females). These numbers haven't changed dramatically despite cultural shifts toward acceptance, suggesting something deeper than social conditioning at work.

Evolution has spent millions of years shaping us to care about paternity certainty, and the evidence is written across the entire animal kingdom. Only 3-9% of mammal species practice any form of monogamy - we're already unusual among mammals for pair bonding at all. But look closer at our primate relatives and the story becomes even clearer. Gibbons form monogamous pair bonds. Gorillas maintain single-male harems where one silverback mates with multiple females. Bonobos and chimpanzees engage in promiscuous mating but don't form committed multi-partner bonds - it's casual sex, not polyamory. Orangutans keep things temporary and solitary. Nowhere in nature do we see what polyamory advocates promote: multiple adults in committed, egalitarian, emotionally bonded partnerships all raising offspring together. The absence of this arrangement across millions of years of mammalian evolution isn't an accident - it's telling us something fundamental about what works.

The reason is paternity certainty. Throughout mammalian evolution, males who ensured their investment went to their own offspring left more descendants than those who didn't. While mammalian mothers are certain of their maternity, fathers face an asymmetry that shaped millions of years of evolutionary psychology. This created powerful mechanisms around mate guarding, sexual jealousy, and pair bonding. Even in species that appear promiscuous, like chimpanzees, males still engage in mate guarding during female fertility. 

The evolutionary logic is ruthless: genes that built brains that cared about paternity certainty reproduced more successfully than those that didn't. 

Why should we feel compelled to go against millions of years of evolutionary programming? 

Going against our nature is how we create imbalance in our lives, stress in our relationships, and confusion in our children about family structure and biological heritage.

Let me be absolutely clear: accepting people and treating everyone with dignity is paramount...

Nobody should have a bad experience or face discrimination for their choices - we're all part of the same human family, all seeking happiness and connection. 

People should be free to explore whatever relationship structures they choose, and reducing shame and stigma genuinely does make society more humane. This societal impulse toward acceptance comes from a good place, from compassion and the recognition that ostracizing people helps no one.

But there's a troubling gap between personal acceptance and cultural promotion. 

When media, academia, and social discourse actively promote polyamory as equally valid or even superior to monogamy, they're conducting a massive social experiment without informed consent. Most people consuming these messages don't have access to the evolutionary logic, the primate research, the millions of years of mammalian psychology that suggest this might not be the best path to happiness... 

They see glossy magazine covers about "ethical non-monogamy," TED talks about jealousy being a social construct, and relationship coaches on social media telling them their discomfort with sharing their partner is just "toxic possessiveness" that needs to be unlearned......

Young people are forming their ideas about relationships from this cultural moment. They're being told that feeling sexual jealousy is backwards, that wanting exclusive commitment is selfish, that the deep mammalian drive for paternity certainty is just patriarchal conditioning. They don't hear about the 97%+ of humans who choose monogamy, or that even our promiscuous primate cousins do not form polyamorous relationships. They don't learn that every human culture independently developed systems around paternal lineage because this actually matters for psychological wellbeing and social stability. Instead, they're encouraged to override their instincts, to intellectually convince themselves that millions of years of evolution got it wrong.
The methodological limitations of relationship research mean we're essentially flying blind while promoting a radical reorganization of human intimacy...

This is becoming a disturbingly common trend in modern culture - the assumption that we can simply think our way out of our biological programming, that evolution is just another outdated system to be disrupted. 

We see it everywhere: in discussions about gender, sexuality, diet, sleep patterns, child-rearing, and now relationship structures. There's an arrogance in believing that a few decades of social theory can overturn millions of years of evolutionary refinement. 

Yes, we're conscious beings capable of choice, and yes, some evolutionary patterns no longer serve us in modern contexts. But the wholesale dismissal of our deepest instincts - the labeling of natural jealousy as "toxic," the reframing of pair bonding as "limiting," the treatment of biological drives as mere social constructs to be overcome - represents a kind of civilizational hubris. We're running a massive experiment on human happiness based on ideology rather than evidence, convincing people that their discomfort with these arrangements is a personal failing rather than their brain trying to tell them something important. The result is a generation increasingly disconnected from their own nature, intellectualizing their way into arrangements that their every instinct warns against, then wondering why they feel anxious, insecure, and unfulfilled despite doing everything the culture tells them is "evolved" and "enlightened."

My wish for you, the reader: 

My wish is that you move through this world with both clarity and compassion - seeking truth about human nature while recognizing that all is self, that we are one consciousness experiencing itself through billions of different perspectives. Don't believe anything, no matter where you hear it or who promotes it, unless it agrees with your own reasoning and common sense. Don't fall victim to institutions weaponizing ethos to push ideologies through slick campaigns and gimmicky phrases that avoid deep examination of evolutionary logic or actual outcomes. Trust your instincts - they contain millions of years of wisdom. Yet never forget that everyone you meet is trying their best to find love and meaning. We're all part of the same human family, all deserving of dignity, even as we acknowledge that some paths typically lead to greater flourishing than others. Hold both truths. They're not contradictory - It makes us make human.

Edit: Aha! another thing:

Cheating actually supports the evolutionary argument for pair bonding, not polyamory.  The fact that it's done secretly is the key - if multiple partners were our natural state, why hide it? Why the guilt, jealousy, and devastation when discovered? The secrecy itself proves we're wired for exclusive bonds. We cheat around the pair bond, not instead of it. If polyamory were natural, there'd be no reason to lie.

What this is describing is called a 'dual mating strategy' in evolutionary psychology.

And also, if you're pair bonded but no offspring are coming, you're evolutionarily stuck in a dilemma. You've invested time and resources in this bond, you have shelter/protection/food sharing set up, but the whole biological point isn't happening.

The "sneaky" strategy makes perfect sense here: maintain your primary bond (because it provides survival advantages, social standing, shared resources) while secretly attempting reproduction elsewhere. This way you don't lose your established partnership benefits, but you still get a shot at passing on your genes.

And if an opportunity for this arises... it makes sense that we might have some inclination to take it, even if we haven't sorted through the logic well enough ourselves to make the right call on that or not... which would almost always for empathic reasons be a no.

but really, evolutionarily speaking, this would've been especially true historically when people didn't understand these fertility issues - you wouldn't know if it was you or your partner who was infertile. So the optimal strategy would be to quietly try elsewhere while keeping your stable bond intact. If successful, you might even raise the offspring within your primary partnership......

This completely explains a lot of modern statistics / behavior - why infidelity rates spike when couples struggle with fertility, why affairs often happen after years without children, why the "7-year itch" coincides with when couples would historically know if they're reproductively compatible.

But notice again - this all revolves around maintaining a PRIMARY pair bond. The cheating is a reproductive backup plan, not evidence that multiple simultaneous partnerships are our natural state. We evolved to pair bond first, then problem-solve around reproductive failures, not to maintain multiple equal emotional partnerships like polyamory suggests.

Also, I would argue that polyamory creates far more opportunities for boundary violations (cheating)...  it's just a bad move overall I think, there's very little trust or security to be gained in these polyamory relationships.
