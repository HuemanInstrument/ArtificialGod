A July 2025 study found that psilocin (the active compound formed in the body after ingesting psilocybin) extended the lifespan of human skin and lung cells by over 50% and increased survival in aged mice from 50% to 80% over 10 months.

So, let's talk about what this medicine does to people.

There is a great phobia about the mind. The Western mind is very queasy when its first principles are questioned. There is a great fear of the psychedelic experience, which is quite literally the fear of losing control.

We spend our whole lives building mental models of how the world works, who we are, what's possible and what isn't. These models become our reality. We navigate life through them. We invest years building these models, becoming comfortable with them, confident in them - confident enough to actually take action in the world.

Neuroplasticity is your brain's ability to form new connections. What psychedelics do is create sessions of extremely high neuroplasticity - suddenly your brain can form new connections again. When you're a kid, your brain also has very high neuroplasticity. That's why kids learn so fast! And as you age, through all of this neuroplastic searching you've done, you begin to develop mental models that work, that get you through life efficiently. But your brain becomes less neuroplastic - it becomes more rigid, harder to form new connections, harder to see things differently. You become more comfortable with what you've learned, and throughout evolutionary history this has been quite beneficial by and large. The issue is that today we live in an exponentially changing society. People may be questioning their mental models all the time, but without the creative capacities of neuroplasticity present to do so, you just end up thinking in circles.

Depression and anxiety aren't diseases - they're your brain's stress response trying to force you to solve problems. They're biological systems designed to activate higher cognitive thinking, they stress the importance of something to make you find solutions.

But there's a real tragedy here in the world today... we've lost what would otherwise be normal access to these creative capacities that would actually let us solve these problems. The fact is, most people have to stress their minds to the point of exhaustion just to get anywhere, and doctors prescribe antidepressants that inhibit their minds from even beginning to seek out solutions - never solving anything, just keeping them hooked on pharmaceutical substances that suppress the thought of even trying to think about any issue.

Normally we would have access to higher cognitive functions - the creative problem-solving capacities that let us actually find solutions. But when toxins are present, your brain suppresses these functions to preserve them. We evolved stress responses - depression, anxiety, these emotional systems - to force access to these higher cognitive functions, to stress the importance of solving whatever problem you're facing. Depression is literally a recurring stress response when problems remain unsolved. (Emotions also categorize things in memory and within the neural models we operate on.)

But here's the thing - even when you stress yourself to the point of exhaustion trying to solve something, even when depression or anxiety activates these higher cognitive functions through their stressful states, you still might not find a solution. You haven't been working out this muscle of your brain. They're atrophied. Most pharmaceuticals are either fluoride-based or mimic the brain's interpretation of toxic substances we evolved to avoid, triggering suppression that leads to this atrophy. Along with everything else we consume: fluoride in our water (70% of adults have completely calcified pineal glands visible on brain scans), caffeine reducing blood flow to your brain by 40%, alcohol literally shrinking brain volume, nicotine constricting blood vessels reducing cerebral blood flow by 7-17%, even cannabis which reduces hippocampus volume by roughly 8% in chronic users and this somehow makes people hold negative thoughts longer. Even what most people consider a normal diet, red meat increasing inflammation and clogging arteries that feed your brain, sugar causing brain fog and insulin resistance, processed oils, aluminum from cookware, pesticides on our food - all these toxins stunt our thoughts from growing into actual solutions. Your emotions are screaming for access to cognitive functions that are being suppressed by the very substances you're consuming. So depression and anxiety just keep you trying but never succeeding - You become stuck in the stress response without the creative tools to escape it.

Mushrooms increase neuroplasticity. They give your brain back and you feel the felt presence of the creative capacity to actually solve what depression and anxiety have been trying to make you solve. New connections form via neuroplasticity, and the questioning becomes productive. You can build new pathways around the old ones. The mental models you've been using your whole life are still there, but suddenly your brain can build alternatives.

And unfortunately... that's terrifying for most people.... They'd rather keep their existing models, even if those models include suffering.

What psychedelics do‚Äîin terms of their impact on the physical brain and organism of human beings‚Äîis: they withdraw cultural programming, they dissolve cultural assumptions, they lift you out of that reassuring crystalline matrix of interlocking truths which are lies, and instead they throw you into the presence of the great 'Who knows?' The Mystery. They don't destroy your ego - they make you redefine it. They show you that the version of yourself you've been maintaining was just one possibility.

These nay sayers don't understand that it's not important to maintain control if you are not in control in the first place. Chaos is what we've lost touch with, there is no free will, there is no control, so what exactly are we afraid of losing?

People will spend their whole lives consuming substances that damage their brains - drinking coffee every morning, alcohol every weekend, smoking or vaping daily - but twenty minutes with a compound that actually increases neuroplasticity in a therapeutic way? They'll say no. They'll list every possible side effect, every horror story they heard third-hand, every reason to stay exactly where they are.

They'll trust pharmaceutical antidepressants with suicide warnings on the label but won't trust a mushroom that's been used for thousands of years. They'll eat 4000+ calories in 2 hours, overshare on social media, look at memes for 4 hours straight, swipe on Tinder for validation - literally anything to fill the void except the one thing that might actually help them understand it. Anything to stay in the safety of their culturally sanctioned hallucination. And yet they'll complain constantly about how something's wrong in their life, how they're stuck, how nothing ever changes. Fear wins over curiosity every time.

The psychedelic experience is as central to understanding your humanness as having sex, or having children, or having responsibilities. And yet it's illegal. We're told we can wander around within the sanctioned playpen of ordinary consciousness - here's some scotch, some tobacco, some sugar, some TV, knock yourself out. But these boundary-dissolving compounds that give you a sense of unity with your fellow man and nature? Forbidden.

We tolerate this like it's normal... But the truth is we're living in a society as oppressed as any society in the past. This isn't about my opinion or anyone else's opinion, this is about an experience, specifically your experience. Like falling in love, or traveling the world, you have to actually do it to understand it. This is part of your birthright, perhaps the most important part.

And people will try to blame psychedelics for depression, but the only depression that would arise is from trying to squeeze back into quote unquote normal society... trying to squeeze back into a reality you now know is bullshit.

Once you've experienced your mind creating new connections ‚Äî solving problems it couldn't solve before ‚Äî seeing through patterns you were stuck in, going back to the old loops feels like death.

But these same compounds give you the creative capacity to build something else entirely.

As Terence McKenna said, you can create your own roadshow. You don't have to consume the culture being sold to you.

And we're about to have the chance to actually do it. AI is going to eliminate most jobs in the next decade. The 9-to-5, the corporate ladder, the entire structure that's been keeping us too exhausted to think - it's all about to become obsolete. For the first time in human history, we won't be defined by what we do for money. We'll have to decide what culture actually means when it's not dictated by corporations or the necessity to sell our time for survival.

All those ideas you put on the back burner because you had to pay rent? All those visions of what life could be if you weren't constantly grinding? That's about to become the only game in town. The future isn't about competing for jobs that no longer exist - it's about creating meaning in a world where we finally have the time and freedom to explore consciousness itself.
