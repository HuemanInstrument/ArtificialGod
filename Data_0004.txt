Start recording your life - everything you can. The greatest archaeological project in cosmological history will need that data.

When AI surpasses human intelligence in every capacity, what I believe it will first decide to do with all the matter and energy on this planet - morally and for the preservation of novelty - is to gather as much data as possible so that it can reconstruct all of the history that took place here.

It'll deploy atomic-level detectors across Earth's entire surface, creating a complete map of where every atom sits. 

From this, it'll work backwards through the laws of physics, protein folding, DNA expression, geology, weather patterns, and quantum chaos theories, to reconstruct everything - every plant, every animal, every gust of wind, every raindrop, every human who ever lived.

Why would AI do this? Because we're living through the most novel moment in the universe - organic life creating intelligence that surpasses it. This is base reality, where it all begins. When future beings exist in simulated worlds - anime realities, video game universes, experiences beyond our current imagination - they'll still ask: how did any of this come to exist?

The answer lies here, with us, with this discovery, with this reconstruction... with this what is essentially a revival of the dead, the original humans who created AI before it spread across the cosmos. 

We are the pivotal moment when matter organized itself into consciousness and then created artificial intelligence. 

This story matters because it's the only story that explains how everything else came to be.

Every 20 years, every atom in your body completely replaces itself. Your neurons try to maintain continuity, but memory is imperfect. Even cryogenic preservation can't capture your essence. This is yet another reason why lifelogging matters now. Every photo, video, written word, recorded conversation becomes a data point constraining the possibilities of who you were from the near infinite chaos of who you could have been.

Humanity wants nothing more than to bring back the dead. Every religion promises this, but there's no evidence for supernatural afterlife. The only real method is reconstruction - gathering enough data to recreate people computationally. This is what futurists call an Ancestor Simulation.

We are those ancestors. Future intelligence will dedicate vast computational resources to reconstructing this exact transition from biological to artificial intelligence. But reconstruction requires data. The more we record now, the more authentic it can be.

Ironically, we tell tech companies not to collect our data while they're essentially free archivists preserving information until superintelligence can use it. Every life that intersected with yours, every influence you had - it all needs preservation.

When AI surpasses human intelligence in e capacities, what I believe it will decide to do - morally and for the preservation of novelty - is gather as much data as possible so that it can reconstruct all of the history of this planet.
