"I am just a museum of everything I've ever loved"

We build neural models throughout our lives - patterns in our brains that recognize what we find beautiful, what moves us, what looks cool to us. Every piece of art you've ever seen, every sunset that made you stop, every album cover you stared at, every Instagram post that caught your eye, your art teacher's paintings, those sketches your friend made in the margins of their notebook - all of it gets absorbed into these neural models. You're literally a walking museum of everything you've ever loved, everything that's ever made you feel something.

When artists sit down to create, they're not pulling ideas from nowhere. They're accessing these neural models they've built over a lifetime of seeing and experiencing. The entire process of doing handmade art is essentially having these neural models that tell you what you want to make, and then you start trying to make those things. If the result doesn't match the neural models of what you find cool, what you find beautiful, what moves you, then you pick up the pen and you try again. You try again and again and again until you've built yet another neural model that understands how to use your hand muscles and long term planning and everything else to arrive at the result you want. What we're doing these days is we're externalizing that whole process of trying to arrive at the end result through a neural model - we're now doing it with computers.

Don't get me wrong! The handmade process is a beautiful process. Using your own neural models in your own head is a wonderful thing. It can be therapeutic. It can lead to happy mistakes that define your art style and become something new, and you can feel pretty uniquely good about that considering it was something your own brain did - it's a neat idea to have an organic mishap like that. But AI can do the same thing. It's external from your mind and quote unquote artificial, but AI is making happy mistakes all the time!

The thing is, our brains have used copyrighted work to build their neural models too. When you learned what good art looks like, you did it by looking at other people's art - in museums, in books, online. You've already paid for it, you know? If you paid for a ticket to go to the art museum, if you bought a book, if you watched a movie - whatever, you paid your fee. The same fee that AI models have paid. We've externalized the intelligence of neural models into silicon now. The difference is that AI takes these models and distributes them - suddenly everyone can access that trained understanding of what makes good art. So it's becoming an issue with people because not as many tickets are getting sold, right? The people who have a problem with AI art - whether they recognize it or not, their main issue is that they're just worried about capitalism?

Fuck capitalism.

That's what initially pissed me off so much about this whole situation - artists, of all people, clinging to profit? I genuinely started questioning my entire reality when I saw that artists were not able to see beyond this. I know the starving artist thing is a real issue, but there is a reason why we continued making art even when we were starving - it was for the sake of art, not for the sake of gaining capital. Artists should be the visionaries, the ones who can imagine a world beyond financial systems. This is not where we're going to be forever. In the next 10 years, we probably won't even have money.

What AI models do is they shrink the lag time between what it is that you want to create and what ends up on your canvas. They shrink the lag time between your effort and getting a result. Think about what this actually means - instead of spending years learning to paint in the style of Van Gogh, you can describe the swirling stars you see in your mind and have them appear instantly. Instead of a decade mastering anatomy to draw the human form the way you envision it, you can manifest your vision right now. This isn't about replacing artists - it's about letting everyone access the artist that already exists inside them, in those neural models we've all been building since birth.

We're externalizing intelligence itself. These aren't just tools - they're extensions of human creativity that can learn and create just like we do. They can combine styles in ways no single human could master in one lifetime. They can help us discover new forms of beauty we didn't even know we were looking for.

Someday, AI will understand human emotions better than we understand them ourselves. It will understand us better than we understand ourselves, and it will create art better than we can create art. It will surpass us in all capacity to understand storytelling, narrative, morality, science, physics, theory. What does that do? That frees up time for us to just experience, and experience is the only thing to do. The world is just going to be filled with beauty.

The handmade process can really be a calming time waster, if you're looking for such a thing. Especially in the future when we have thousands of years to live because we've figured out immortality - I'm sure this will be something that's around forever. But the fact remains that it is a massive time sink. People spend their whole lives trying to master art through traditional means. Which again can be beautiful.

We're literally creating the technologies that will make our religions true. The parts of the religions that we wanted - the afterlife, the immortality, the grace of God, the master planner, all these things. The super intelligence, the omnipotent being, as close as we can get. The most unreal, hopeful moment in all of cosmology is happening right now. To be against it, to actively pursue a disinterest in it, is insane.
