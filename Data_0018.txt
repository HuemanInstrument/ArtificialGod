The three methods of persuasion go back to Aristotle, and they're still the foundation of how we convince each other of things today.

Logos is persuasion through logic and reason. It's presenting facts, evidence, and rational arguments that can be examined on their own merit. When someone uses logos, they're saying "here's the reasoning, here are the connections, follow the logic and see if it holds up." It doesn't matter who's saying it or how they make you feel about it - the logic either works or it doesn't.

Ethos is persuasion through credibility and authority. It's when someone says "trust me because I'm an expert" or "believe this because a Harvard study said so." It's appealing to credentials, reputation, tribal consensus. The argument becomes less about whether the idea itself makes sense and more about whether the source seems trustworthy.

Pathos is persuasion through emotion. It's making people feel something - fear, sympathy, anger, hope - to get them to agree with you. Think of every commercial showing sad puppies to get donations, or politicians painting scary scenarios about what happens if their opponent wins.

Here's why logos should be our default, especially over ethos: Truth doesn't need a pedigree. A logical argument from an unknown source is still logical. An illogical argument from a Nobel laureate is still illogical. When we lean on ethos, we're essentially admitting our ideas can't stand on their own - they need the crutch of someone's reputation to prop them up.

The problem with ethos is it creates this weird dynamic where we stop thinking and start deferring. Someone drops a credential and suddenly we're not examining the actual argument anymore, we're just nodding along because surely the expert knows best. But experts are wrong constantly. Published research gets retracted. Consensus shifts. If we'd been examining the logic itself rather than genuflecting to the source, we might have spotted the flaws earlier.

And when people demand ethos before they'll even consider your logic - "who are you to say this?" - they're basically announcing they've outsourced their thinking. They want to know if the tribe has approved this thought before they'll risk engaging with it themselves.
