My biggest pet peeve is when someone begins to laugh at your position during a debate.

There's nothing funny about watching someone operate with a broken mental model of reality. It's actually sad - like watching someone navigate with a broken compass.

When someone starts laughing at your argument, they've already decided your mental model is worthless and your understanding is fundamentally stupid. They stop addressing your actual points and shift into performing ridicule. The message is clear: "I don't respect you enough to engage seriously." How can you have productive communication with someone who's essentially saying you're not worth the effort? It's not effective at all - it just kills any chance of understanding.

This gets worse in public forums. When there's an audience watching, people may feel even more compelled to mock. It's likely they're performing for whoever they think will agree with them, trying to rally their tribe and marginalize your perspective.

Why do they do this? It's simple. They're running your ideas through their consensus filter - their model of what they believe everyone knows to be true. But the bigger issue is that genuinely considering new ideas is physically exhausting. It takes real effort - cortisol, stress hormones, mental strain - to consider that what you think or believe might be wrong. So some people just give up. They don't have the mental energy for that. Maybe they're already stretched thin managing kids, careers, mortgages, aging parents - their cognitive resources are maxed out just keeping life together.

Sometimes what you're presenting requires them to overhaul their entire understanding of reality. That's overwhelming, I get it. But I can't stand someone disrespecting me with an "LOL" and no longer considering what I'm saying. Just stop talking to me if that's how it's going to be.

I imagine it like a soft— subconscious voice tells them they already know the truth and you're the stupid one. But it's never been about stupidity or being right or wrong. It's about discussing. Scientists estimate the human brain performs the CMOS computational equivalent of about 1 exaflop. When two people discuss, that's 2 exaflops working on a problem. Get 50 people genuinely engaging? That's 50 exaflops. We shouldn't limit ourselves to our individual processing power when we could be combining minds to actually understand reality. But mockery is exactly that limitation - a primitive monkey-mind tool that signals "don't climb the ladder" instead of explaining why the ladder might be dangerous.

It's a sad world when we stay in our little ponds, afraid of larger forums. We default to protecting the models we already have. It feels better than sitting with uncertainty you can't mentally or emotionally solve, than rebuilding your understanding, than admitting you might have been wrong about something fundamental.

But if you were truly confident in your understanding, why would you need to perform ridicule? It's fragile beliefs that need protection through mockery.

If the truth can be told so as to be understood, it will be believed.

There's real power in the effort to explain things on someone's level. The laughter, the "LOL," the dismissal - these are just primitive tools we use to maintain tribal conformity, the same way we were once coaxed into line ourselves.  It's a relic of our evolutionary history, it needs to be done away with.
