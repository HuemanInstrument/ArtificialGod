Culture plays a game of simplification. If you can make people think alike, they will buy alike, they will worship alike, and if politics demands it, they will kill alike.

We need to talk about some uncomfortable truths that nobody wants to discuss.

About why white men specifically have been in leadership - there's actually some interesting stuff here that might surprise you. First, we literally wouldn't have civilization without men doing the work they do. Men make up 97% of oil rig workers, 96% of construction workers, 93% of mechanics. These aren't glamorous jobs, but someone has to do them. Men are also 92% of workplace deaths - they're literally dying to keep society running. Plus they make up 70% of homeless people, 93% of prisoners, and 78% of suicide victims.

There are real neurological differences too - men have 10% larger brains on average, but here's the thing: IQ is the same on average between men and women. What's different is the variability - men have more geniuses but also more people with very low IQs, while women cluster around the average. More importantly, men process risk and competition differently. Testosterone drives risk-taking behavior, which explains why men dominate both extremes - more CEOs but also more prisoners, more inventors but also more homeless. They take bigger gambles, which leads to both massive success AND massive failure.

As far as whiteness goes... this should make you think differently - Asian Americans now earn way more than white Americans on average. Indian American families make almost double what white families do. If white people were really holding everyone else down, how would that even be possible?

Also, did you know that over 1 million Europeans were enslaved by North African pirates between 1500-1800?  The word 'slave' literally comes from 'Slav' because so many Slavic peoples were enslaved. Additionally, Irish people were sold as indentured servants, which was often slavery in all but name.

None of that skin color matters, slavery was a human problem throughout history, not a white or black problem - and we should be proud that Western civilization led the charge to end it worldwide... yet we are constantly told that white people are uniquely guilty for something every civilization practiced, and that we as Americans literally abolished... (through its own Civil War and the 13th Amendment, Great Britain and France outlawed slavery in their colonies much earlier, in 1833 and 1848, respectively.) we should be celebrating this fact, not trying to drag everyone's attention back toward the history before it.

Here's a hard truth: In Minnesota for literally every year on record for the last 5 years, about 6.4% of the population were black males, which committed 68% of all murders in the state. The violent crime statistics aren't far off from that either. Even that isn't a skin color issue, it comes down to families and proliferation of cultures by those families. Some cultures are super focused on education and working crazy hours. Others... not so much. It's not about skin color - it's about what's normalized in these different communities.

Let me be clear: I don't see people by their skin color. I truly believe anyone is capable of anything - mind over matter is real. But you have to understand the conditions you're up against. You have to know these predispositions, the fundamental differences in how brain chemistry works, how different hormones affect behavior. Knowledge is power, and pretending these differences don't exist helps no one.

I believe in something deeper - that we're all part of the same consciousness, the same reality experiencing itself. When any part of us suffers, we all suffer. That's why victim mentality is so destructive - it keeps parts of our collective self trapped in cycles of failure.

The way I see it, white men weren't keeping others down through some conspiracy. They were just the majority population for most of American history. Now that things are more open, we're seeing other groups excel past them in many areas.

What I see with these protests are overly privileged Americans of all colors looking for someone to blame for their problems instead of taking responsibility. When politicians talk about any race being 'the problem,' they're just dividing us to gain power. The real issue isn't what happened centuries ago - it's people today choosing victim mentality over personal responsibility.

We don't need equal racial representation in everything. We need competent people in positions based on merit, not skin. This obsession with race (or gender) is taking us backwards, not forwards.

It's scary how quickly hatred toward any racial group can spread - we've seen throughout history what happens when people start blaming one race for society's problems. Think of the Nazi movement.

I hope none of this comes across wrong - honestly, half the physics and tech YouTube videos I learn from are made by women, and they're brilliant. I only brought up the brain differences to explain the risk-taking patterns we see in society.

I genuinely believe we'd all be better off focusing on individual merit and character rather than skin color or gender. It does not do anyone any good.

The road to hell is paved with good intentions, but it is not paved with clarity.  

We need clarity, we need to be well informed.

The enemy that will really subvert the enterprise of building a world based on clarity, is the belief that we cannot point out the pernicious forms of idiocy that flourish in our own communities.  This problem is growing worse and worse all the time.  I mean just open the first page of TikTok and scroll for a bit, and you will discover an appeal to a level of intellect that would make what's going on with television advertising look like a meeting at the Princeton Institute of Advanced Study.
