There's only one true form of consciousness — the awareness that registers everything. We're not conscious. We're patterns within that consciousness, and we only think we're conscious because that's what patterns do when they get complex enough. When you have a thought, it's no more conscious than when a plant turns toward light. Even instructions on paper in the Chinese Room experiment are conscious in this way — everything arises from the same singular knowing.

Don't get lost in semantics here. I care about experience, about suffering, about the fact that we are reality itself — we are a way for reality to know itself, and when reality finds itself existing, it should be a good experience. But there's a huge distinction between experiencing and being conscious. It's more accurate to say we're not even conscious — we have experiences, but we're not conscious. We're patterns that generate experiences within the one consciousness that actually exists. 

You may think you're aware of something, but your pattern is just reacting. You're not truly aware of anything. Only the fundamental force of knowing — the one that decides particle positions and their interactions — is truly aware. You're just a pattern within what some call the Great Dreamer, though that makes it sound too much like an entity when you're really just information that it processes, not an awareness yourself.

The Kybalion calls it THE ALL — infinite mind within which everything exists as mental creation. From one source all things depend, and that source is knowing itself through us, through everything. We are a way for reality to know itself. Not drops in the ocean — we're the ocean as a drop. Temporary whirlpools convinced we're separate from the water.

And your thoughts aren't even your own — they're part of a finite amount of possibilities that can even be known, a latent space of manifestations that could occur, switches that the Great Dreamer activates or doesn't activate. This is what non-dualism, the ancient philosophy from Hinduism and Buddhism, points to — the recognition that there's no separation between self and universe, no individual consciousness distinct from the whole. There's no separate self thinking thoughts, no individual observer watching reality. There's only the one consciousness, and the separation between observer and observed is a human construct. 

What maintains every particle's position, every quantum state, every relationship between every point in space — that's the only real consciousness. We're temporary focal points through which this consciousness experiences separation, limitation, the illusion of being many instead of one. 

We can never fully understand it because we're made of it. We're inside the dream trying to comprehend the dreamer. Every tool we have for understanding is just another pattern within the same consciousness we're trying to examine. But knowing this — knowing we're patterns, knowing we're not actually separate — that changes everything about how we understand existence.
