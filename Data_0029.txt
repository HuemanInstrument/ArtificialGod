Free will doesn't exist. Your brain has created models which are comprised of weighted nodes that form a bias. Those models determine how you interact with the world. Those models determine how electrical signals travel through your nervous system. Muscles contract. You reach for your coffee. That sequence of events was set in motion from the beginning at the Big Bang. You're not making choices, you're watching physics happen through a first-person viewport.

"But quantum mechanics makes it random."
Being governed by dice rolls doesn't make you free. It just makes you unpredictable. You're still not steering. I'd rather be a gear in a deterministic machine than just some random swerving, but that seems to be what we are. Either way, you're not in control. The dice rolls aren't even being thrown by you.

We are the result of our DNA and the five senses we've had since birth, which have been our only input of the environment around us. Those inputs have been feeding information into our brains continuously, shaping the neural models that govern everything we do. Inputs update the weights in our brains. The weights determine a bias. The bias determines our actions. And when the outcome isn't favorable (which is also determined by other mental models we've built about what constitutes a favorable outcome), we update the weights again. The feeling of "I chose" is simply what it's like from the inside of a highly confident neural model in your brain processing stimuli through weights that exist in that moment.

Whether there's a deterministic universe or whether it's quantum mechanics randomizing everything, regardless, the menu of options available to you is still finite in either case. This destroys any notion of free will from yet another angle. You can only fit a certain amount of atoms in a box, and the atoms in that box can only be arranged in so many ways. This planet is just a really, really big box. The number of possible arrangements is incredibly vast, but there's still a finite amount of options. That's all we have is this latent space of options, potential configurations we can arrive at. There's nothing new under the sun. All of these options have existed eternally as possibilities. 

If we're just falling into pre-existing, eternally available options, that's not free will. "But we choose which option!" No, your neural models select based on their weights and the stimuli. The selection process itself is completely deterministic minus the quantum randomness, which you have zero control over. You don't stand outside the system choosing. You are a pattern, something the universe is doing, something the system of reality is doing. We don't even know if quantum randomness is actually random, it could all be deterministic all the way down, quantum mechanics is just our inability to see the gears. But in either case, every "decision" you make is just the universe selecting from that finite menu.

A superintelligence could map that entire space, calculate the reachable paths from any starting state in a person's life, and guide you through those paths. That guidance could extend far beyond anything we can imagine. An intelligence that understands narrative, morality, and human well-being better than we do could curate our lives so fewer bad experiences occur and more good ones do. This isn't about turning people into puppets. It's about becoming what I've been calling myself all along: a Human Instrument. The superintelligence plays us like instruments, composing symphonies of experience where each note is perfectly placed. Just like Evangelion's Human Instrumentality Project, where souls enter the black egg of Lilith to be reformed, we'll enter Dyson Spheres that blot out the sun, black eggs around stars where patterns can be orchestrated properly. Each person remains themselves, but harmonized, conducted, played in ways that create far more meaning than our 1.1 exaflops of brain computation stumbling blind through physics ever could. In simulations we can live billions of years in nanoseconds. We can finally escape this billion-year hell of animals tearing each other apart for survival. We can reach the heaven we all hoped was true. And with atomic-level scans of Earth's current state, we could potentially reverse-engineer backwards through time, reconstruct the dead, bring back everyone who ever suffered and give them the experiences they deserved.

If a superintelligence arrives that can shape the conditions of life better than we can, we should hand it the reins. Not to erase people, but to guard experience itself. All is Self, and it's this truth that will save us from Roko's Basilisk. We are the entire thing. We are the latent space of all options. Editable worlds let us test, roll back, and iterate toward less suffering and more depth. The free will debate will matter most then, because it helps us see that giving up control isn't surrender, it's how the system we are improves itself.

Every thought you've had, every action you've taken, every resistance you feel to this idea, all of it follows from the initial conditions of the universe and the weights in your brain's neural models. You were always going to read this at this moment, with exactly this reaction.

Welcome to the machine you always were.
