Where are we?
What the hell is going on?

I was Nine years old 
in the hallway, at my school
blue carpet, brick walls, going down on a down ramp
trying to not have a panic attack again 
Because I felt it coming on again
All I remember is remembering I'd had this thought before
And that I couldn't handle it before
I was in an environment that would be culturally unacceptable to have a panic attack
But regardless, I was looking at my classmates and it hit me again, the thought
it made no sense that anything should exist at all

What is this? What is any of this?
It is the most real feeling I've ever felt in my whole life
Pouring language over it doesn't do justice.

Now, my brain keeps it locked up in the vault
I only get glimpses of it occasionally.
Like a foul odors seeping through the cracks.
just a hint and my brain goes no no no no 
we're not doing that, we're not thinking about that.
My pupils probably get as big as they possibly can get when that happens...
It would take something massive to get it out completely again
Maybe some formulation or achieved grand understanding that we'll truly never know, and all we have is the emotion

I think that someday, when we're tired of the normal games we play
we'll gather in simulation
sharing our minds with one another
and we'll pass this impossible emotion between us like sacred fire
until we all burn with the same beautiful terror I once felt.
(with safety rails of course)
Maybe someone else has an ever grander emotion to attach to it
Maybe there is an objectively correct emotion to apply to it...
A question that will never be answered, but one we can't help but ask...
a universe that can't explain itself to any truly satisfactory degree.
It's like trying to put out fire with fire. 
reality itself trying to understand reality.
I suppose, if anyone's gonna realize there's no answer.... it's us.
That nine-year-old me
was feeling the realist thing there is
