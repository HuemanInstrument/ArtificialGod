I've been thinking.. about where consciousness begins. 
Not which species evolved it first, but what's the minimum neural architecture needed for experience to exist at all?

Plants react to their environment in sophisticated ways - they turn toward light, release chemicals when damaged, even communicate with each other through root networks. When sunlight hits a leaf, photoreceptor proteins change shape, triggering cascades that eventually bend the stem. But there's no integration of these signals into a unified experience. Each cell responds independently to its local environment - there's no central processing system where information converges, no structure that could generate what we'd recognize as perception or awareness. It's the difference between a thousand separate thermostats adjusting to temperature and a weather station that actually models the climate.

Evolution only builds consciousness when it serves a purpose - when an organism needs to make rapid decisions, predict futures, remember threats. A plant can't run from danger or chase food. It doesn't need to feel fear to motivate escape because escape isn't an option. It just needs mechanical responses: grow toward light, repair damage, release toxins when grazed. But look at what happens when mobility enters the picture - suddenly you need eyes to see threats coming, neural networks to process that information quickly, memory to avoid danger next time. Consciousness emerges because it's useful for navigating a world where you can actually do something about the threats you perceive.

This brings us to the harder questions. If consciousness scales with neural complexity and evolutionary need, where do we draw lines? Mammals and birds clearly have the hardware - complex brains, integrated sensory systems, behaviors that show planning and emotion. We can safely assume they're conscious. Their experience is similar to ours, and our evolutionary history isn't far off. We share common ancestors with dogs and cats from just 100 million years ago. Their brains have the same basic structures - hippocampus for memory, amygdala for fear, cortical regions for processing. When a dog anticipates a walk or a cat remembers where you keep the treats, they're using neural architecture fundamentally similar to ours. They dream, they play, they grieve. The evidence for their consciousness is overwhelming.

But what about simpler nervous systems? A shrimp has 10,000 neurons. A spider has 100,000. Are these enough to generate even primitive experience, or are they just sophisticated biological robots - responding to inputs with pre-programmed outputs but no inner experience? The uncertainty is maddening because the stakes are so high. Every day, 200 million animals die for food. If we're wrong about where consciousness begins (and most people haven't even considered the question), we could be participating in suffering on an unimaginable scale.

Humans have 86 billion neurons. That's 8.6 million times more than a shrimp. But we know you don't need anywhere near that many neurons to feel pain - dogs have 500 million and clearly suffer when hurt. They have the same basic brain structures we use to process pain and fear. We know single-celled organisms aren't conscious. We know mammals with millions of neurons are. Somewhere between one cell and maybe 100 million neurons, experience flickers into existence. But what is the minimum neural configuration that can generate even the most basic sensation of pain or fear? We don't have the technology to answer this definitively. Until we do, we need to be extremely careful about what we're willing to risk. Because fundamentally, we're all the same thing - the universe experiencing itself from different perspectives. Every conscious moment is reality knowing what it feels like to exist. If we're creating suffering anywhere in that spectrum, we're essentially torturing ourselves.

Through evolution, every lifeform on this planet has been pushed up the complexity scale as far as the benefit that consciousness would provide it. Our own human brains evolved to have 86 billion neurons because consciousness proved so advantageous - letting us model complex futures, maintain detailed memories, integrate vast amounts of sensory data. Pain taught our ancestors to avoid damage. Fear drove them to escape threats. These experiences were critical for evolution - without them, our lineage wouldn't have survived.

If even basic experiences improved survival odds for simple organisms, natural selection would have discovered the minimum viable configuration after hundreds of millions of years. Maybe 10,000 neurons is enough for the most primitive flash of sensation. Maybe you need 1,000,000 before anything resembling experience emerges. We simply don't know what patterns of neural firing create the difference between processing and feeling.

Take ants. With about 250,000 neurons, they navigate by tracking the sun's position, maintain complex social hierarchies, and teach each other new routes to food sources. They pass the mirror test - recognizing themselves when marked with paint. They rescue injured colony members, carrying them back to the nest for recovery. When separated from their colony, some ants wander endlessly searching, refusing food until they die. Is that genuine distress at losing their social connections, or just broken programming when removed from chemical signals? The behavior looks like grief, but we still don't know - can an experience occur within this brain comprised of just 250,000 neurons?

Suffering has been happening for hundreds of millions of years - nature is brutal, evolution is built on endless death and pain. But we're the first species that can actually understand what we're doing and choose differently. We know animals can suffer. We know we don't need to eat them to survive. Yet we kill 200 million of them every day, mostly because we like how they taste. I'm not trying to guilt anyone - I ate meat for years, and changing your diet is genuinely difficult when everything around you is built to make animal products convenient and plant-based options an afterthought. But at some point we have to face what we're doing.

Every breath shares the same air
We all emerged from the same salty ocean
Will you carry this knowing within?
In your thoughts, in your choices, in your being
The further we drift from this truth,
the more lost we become
But I hold no judgment‚Äî
how could I, when we are one?
