Surface water contains around 0.05 ppm of fluoride. Rain water has 0.008 ppm. For millions of years, that's what we drank. Over the last 10,000 years or so, we discovered well water and slowly adopted it out of convenience. What was unknown to us is that well water typically contains 0.1 to 0.7 ppm of fluoride - levels our evolutionary history never prepared us for. 

Now, cities actually mandate 0.7 ppm as some purported benefit to dental health - that's 14 times higher than what our genetics have had time to account for. Just to give some further perspective here, since I know 0.7 parts per million doesn't sound like a lot - a pea-sized amount of fluoridated toothpaste contains about as much fluoride as a glass of city water, and the toothpaste tube tells you to call poison control if swallowed.

Fluoride only works topically on teeth. Ingesting it provides zero benefit. Life itself has never incorporated fluoride as an essential compound for any biological process. 

What's really shocking is that fluoride has the highest electronegativity of any element - if you lay out all the elements on the entire periodic table from least electronegative to most electronegative, there's literally a one-eighth gap between oxygen and fluorine, this massive jump where fluorine just grabs electrons from everything around it, never satisfied, disrupting normal biological functions just by being present.

Your brain has protective mechanisms that restrict access to higher cognitive functions when toxins like fluoride are present. It's trying to protect its most sophisticated problem-solving abilities from damage. So what happens? You need stress hormones to override these protective mechanisms. Depression, anxiety, anger - these emotions become the only way to demand access to your full cognitive capacity in this toxified state. 

This is why we can't get out of our ruts, why we're stuck in these cycles of self-destructive behaviors. Depression medication just doubles down on the suppression - instead of helping you access those higher functions to solve problems, it makes you forget the problems exist. You become this poorly programmed robot who can't properly respond to situations that need actual solutions.

We use fluoridated water to grow crops, feed livestock - the fluoride accumulates in animal bones (fluorosis), and when we use mechanically deboned meat processes, that concentrated fluoride ends up in our food. 

Everything in our food system is contaminated. And sorry, I know this can be a sensitive subject, but this is exactly the same substance that was used to force Jewish people into calm submission during the Nazi Germany days - that's documented history. Whether intentional or not, it's certainly having that effect on populations today. The cancer connection is obviously concerning - men who drink seven or more cups of tea daily have a 50% increased risk of prostate cancer University of Glasgow - University news - Archive of news - 2012 - June - Tea drinkers at greater risk of prostate cancer. Black tea averages 3-4 ppm of fluoride - that's 5 times higher than city water. The tea plant accumulates both fluoride AND aluminum in its leaves at very high levels, and it's a well known fact that aluminum increases the toxic build of fluoride in your body, making it far more difficult to dispose of.

It's awful how difficult it is to avoid, Raisins can have extremely high levels, Mechanically deboned meat, chicken nuggets, hot dogs - all loaded with fluoride from bone fragments, anything cooked in non-stick pans adds more, Grape juice, wine, beer made with fluoridated water, pesticides sprayed on crops contain fluoride compounds, even organic produce irrigated with fluoridated water absorbs it. 

That may seem overwhelming, but you're better than this, you can do this, and the majority of this can be fixed by making a few key changes. Get a reverse osmosis or distillation system for your water - or use the grocery store water machines like I've been doing for 15 years, glass jugs work great for transport if you're concerned about plastic.  

Replace your non-stick pans with stainless steel, cast iron, or even glass cookware. 

Stop drinking black tea or any tea from the Camellia sinensis plant - dandelion tea is a great alternative and actually healthy. 

Cook your own food from scratch to avoid evaporative accumulation of fluoride left behind in foods cooked in fluoridated water.

Source your meat properly - or better yet, go plant-based. As someone who's been vegan for 14 years I had to mention it, sorry, do your thing! It's all good, I'd never hate on someone for not doing it.

Also, it would be morally irresponsible of me not to mention this, as it can seriously damage heart function: if you filter your water, you must remineralize it. Removing fluoride also removes essential minerals like magnesium and calcium that your body needs to absorb from water specifically. Without them, you risk heart problems and other deficiencies. I use a simple 2-gallon glass water dispenser with lab-tested fluoride-free remineralization medium. I don't want to make this an ad so I'll leave it at that.

Your body tries to filter fluoride through two main organs - the kidneys and the pineal gland. The kidneys manage to excrete about 50% of daily fluoride intake, converting it to calcium fluoride that exits through urine. The pineal gland, which has the second highest blood flow per volume in the entire body after the kidneys, acts as a second filter specifically for the brain's blood supply. It's trying to protect your brain from fluoride exposure. But under constant bombardment from fluoridated water, the pineal accumulates massive calcium fluoride deposits - up to 21,000 ppm of calcium fluoride can be found in the calcifying tissues of the pineal gland. 

In fact, 70% of adults who get brain scans show visible calcification of their pineal gland. This gland produces melatonin, regulates your sleep cycles, and potentially produces compounds that activate DMT. Some researchers believe it's connected to consciousness itself. When we stop the fluoride intake, the body can begin to clear these deposits and restore pineal function.

This calcification is certainly reducing cognitive function. But here's the thing - it isn't necessarily permanent. Your body has remarkable regenerative abilities. Stop the constant barrage of fluoride, give your system a chance to heal, and the pineal gland can potentially rejuvenate itself. In a clean biological system, you'd have the creative capacity present to find solutions to life's problems - the mental tools to work through psychological issues, everyday challenges. 

That's what fluoride steals from us. The ability to think clearly, to access our full problem-solving potential, to break out of destructive patterns. We become these poorly programmed robots, stuck in ruts, unable to access the higher cognitive functions that could actually solve our problems. And the worst part? Most people will never know what they're missing.

There's a reason psychedelics can be so revelatory for people - they force access to those creative problem-solving capacities that fluoride suppresses. They either override the protective mechanisms or trick the brain into thinking it's in a dream state where those higher functions naturally activate. Just food for thought, but here's a wild theory: DMT oxidizes readily. What if it has an affinity for fluoride? What if the pineal produces DMT partially as a buffer medium to absorb and neutralize fluoride in the brain? That could explain why a calcified pineal might produce less DMT, leading to diminished dream states and spiritual experiences. 

But the pattern is clear - whether through psychedelics temporarily bypassing the blockage, or through eliminating fluoride to restore natural function, the goal is the same: regaining access to our full cognitive and creative potential. The question is whether we'll choose the band-aid or address the root cause. And yes, I'm referring to psychedelics as the band-aid here - the root cause is the toxins we consume. In the natural human state, we likely produce enough endogenous psychedelics for normal consciousness and problem-solving. 

That's my theory at least. Though to be fair, psychedelics can be a powerful tool for overcoming years of bad mental model building - that massive neuroplastic session can help rewire decades of destructive patterns. Important disclaimer: if anyone is considering psychedelics as an alternative to depression medication, there are now medical facilities that offer this professionally.  Do not attempt this on your own. As awkward as it may feel, professionals truly can guide you toward positive outcomes. This isn't something to experiment with solo - proper set, setting, and guidance are essential for safety and healing.
